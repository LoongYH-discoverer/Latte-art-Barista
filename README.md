# Latte-art-Barista
I am thinking of making a software that teaches latte art.
I noticed that there is only A FEW latte art style made by HUMAN in REGULAR cafe shop, 
and because of    human brains    do not have the ability to calculate how foam milk spread and how they will affect the shape of the other foam milk on surface of the coffee.
So, it is probaly a tailor-made job for computer.
To calculate the spreads affect the other spreads.
To caluculate angle, sharpness and thickness of foam milk to pour.
To calculate when to shake and when to shake harder.( computer might come up with new idea on pouring technique ?)
To make easy and more style on barista art that people can learn, achieve and present in coffee shop.
Not those real art for people admire it rather than drink it.
Just a little special than regular barsita.
More userfriendly to newcomer to barista.
